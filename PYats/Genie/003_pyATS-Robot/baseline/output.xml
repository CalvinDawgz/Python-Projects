Cisco 7206VXR (NPE400) processor (revision A) with 491520K/32768K bytes of memory.
Processor board ID 4279256517
R7000 CPU at 150MHz, Implementation 39, Rev 2.1, 256KB L2 Cache
6 slot VXR midplane, Version 2.1

Last reset from power-on

PCI bus mb0_mb1 (Slots 0, 1, 3 and 5) has a capacity of 600 bandwidth points.
Current configuration on bus mb0_mb1 has a total of 800 bandwidth points. 
The set of PA-2FE, PA-POS-2OC3, and I/O-2FE qualify for "half 
bandwidth points" consideration, when full bandwidth point counting 
results in oversubscription, under the condition that only one of the 
two ports is used. With this adjustment, current configuration on bus 
mb0_mb1 has a total of 400 bandwidth points. 
This configuration is within the PCI bus capacity and is supported 
under the above condition. 

PCI bus mb2 (Slots 2, 4, 6) has a capacity of 600 bandwidth points.
Current configuration on bus mb2 has a total of 0 bandwidth points 
This configuration is within the PCI bus capacity and is supported. 

Please refer to the following document "Cisco 7200 Series Port Adaptor
Hardware Configuration Guidelines" on Cisco.com &lt;http://www.cisco.com&gt;
for c7200 bandwidth points oversubscription and usage guidelines.
